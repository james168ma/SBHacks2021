# SBHACKS 2021

### Inspiration

Have you ever had trouble telling what another person was feeling while talking to them? Have you ever offended someone because you didn't know how to read the situation?

We wanted to create a solution to help solve this problem.

### What it does

Our app, Emotion Detector â€“ A Handy EQ Helper, can help you in times of need! All you need to do is pull out your phone, take a photo of the person, and our app will take it from there. Emotion Detector uses Google Cloud's Vision API to accurately detect emotions of the person in the photo, and uses that information to suggest actions that you could take in those situations. Emotion Detector also has a gallery feature, where you'll be able to remind yourself of those good times by seeing all the previous photos you've taken, if you choose to save them.
